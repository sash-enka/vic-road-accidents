    <h1>Victorian Road Accidents in 2020</h1>
    <h4 class="subheading">Lets explore 2020's Victorian road incident data</h4>
    <br>

    <h3>Victorian Road Accidents - Interactive Map</h1>
    <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1" id="interactive_map1"></div>
        <div class="pure-u-1"> 
          <p> Interactive map above displays the location of ll Victorian road incidents in 2020. 
            The size of the circle represents the number of people involved in the incident. The larger 
            the circle, the more people were involved. The colour of the circle represents the type of 
            incident that took place. Click on an accident type via the legend to further filter the 
            visualisation.

            Additionally, you are able to use the Zoom toggle to get a clearer view of the accidents, 
            as you Zoom into Melbourne city - the locality with the highest number of road accidents in 2020.

    <h3>Number of Accidents by Accident Type</h1>

      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
          <p>
            The colour densities in the above interactive map shows us that the most common
            types of accidents were collisions with otheer vehicles, and collisions with fixed objects. 
            The following stacked area chart further elaborates on this by showing you the exact 
            distribution of accident types, along with a timeframe, in months. 
          </p>

    <h3>Number of Accidents by Region</h1>
      <div class="pure-g">

            This pie chart displays the distribution of Victorian road accidents on 
            the separate regions. It is made clear with this visualisatio that the 
            Metropolitan North West, and Metropolitan South East regions have a disproportionate 
            amount of car accidents compared to the other regions. Reasons for this could be the fact that
            these areas are more populated and have well established transport infrastructure; 
            putting more people on their roads and transport network.

    <h3>LGAs with the Highest Number of Accidents</h1>
      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
          <p>
            The following visualisation shows us the spread of accidents across the different LGAs. 
            As you can see, the LGAs that have the highest nuber of road accidents are Melbourne, Casey, 
            Geelong, Hume, Dandenong and Monash. Several factors can contribute to this outcome, including 
            the population and area of the relevant LGA.

          The following exploratory visualisation allows you to filter the accidents by LGAs and accident severity.
